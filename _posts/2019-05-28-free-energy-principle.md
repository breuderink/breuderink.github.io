title:  The free energy principle
categories: [learning, information theory]

When I stumbled on Friston's free energy principle (FEP) and active inference it
[sounded important and
profound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1egnoCWgUg&t=14s). It basically
states that to predict the future, we have to create it. Using a Bayesian
framework, one can introduce a prior expectation of preferred behavior, and then
the agent has to resolve the difference between its expectations and reality by
either updating the believes or by acting on reality.

However, the papers are very hard to read, and use a lot of math from
[statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics). I
cannot completely put it in a reinforcement learning perspective, it feels like
it does not make practical predictions. Have there been practical applications
of the free energy principle that demonstrates its value?
