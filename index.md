I'm Boris Reuderink, a machine learning expert. For as long as I can remember,
I've been driven to solve the puzzle of intelligence â€” and I still am. Along
the way, I've developed a talent for finding patterns in complex datasets and
training elegant algorithms to make useful predictions. My expertise includes
developing algorithms that analyze biosignals (think blood pressure,
photoplethysmograms, and EEG brain signals). If you're working on health and
fitness apps or medical devices, I might be able to help you get more out of
your data. If you need a consultant who knows machine learning, I'm here.
